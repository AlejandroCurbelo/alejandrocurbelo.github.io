# About Me

I am Alejandro Curbelo Fontelos, a Computer Engineer from the Technological Institute of the Canary Islands. With a passion for conservation and technology, I am actively involved in projects that aim to conserve and protect the environment.

I am a sincere and respectful person. I have an easy laugh, but I put seriousness first whenever the situation requires it. I also prefer criticism to silence, and if I think I know of a better option, I don't hesitate to say so.

### Interests

As a computer engineer, I have a passion for technology and problem-solving. However, I also have other interests that I enjoy exploring:

- Botanical Biology: Although I pursued a career in computer engineering, my love for botanical biology remains. I enjoy learning about different plant species, their characteristics, and their impact on ecosystems. It's a fascinating subject that I like to delve into whenever I can.

- Music: Music holds a special place in my heart, and I believe it is one of the greatest forms of expression. I am particularly drawn to playing musical instruments, with the guitar being my primary instrument of choice. I find solace and joy in creating melodies and harmonies, and the process of learning and improving my skills has been immensely rewarding. It's a wonderful way for me to relax, unleash my creativity, and connect with others who share the same passion.

By combining my technical knowledge with my diverse interests, I strive to bring a unique perspective to my work and continuously explore the intersections between technology, biology, and music.

If you have any recommendations for fascinating plants, songs, or want to share your musical journey, feel free to reach out to me. Let's connect and explore the amazing world of technology, biology, and music together!
